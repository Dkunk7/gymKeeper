# Gym Keeper

### Problem Statement

I've been a gymgoer for a few years now, and I've struggled to keep track of my workouts over an extended period of time. I noticed other people using pen and paper to write down their reps and weight, but I didn't want to bring anything unnecessary to the gym. This led me to use a notepad on my phone for a while, which worked, but it felt clunky and inefficient.

Since most people these days carry a smartphone almost everywhere, I think it makes sense to have an application that combines the organization of pen and paper with the convenience of being able to add things quickly. My goal with Gym Keeper is to create that experience.
